Tags help with **organization, filtering, and access control** across your workspace.

- Click **Add Tag** to save it.
- Once created, tags will appear in the **Current Tags** list.

## Current Tags

- Displays all the tags your team has created.
- If no tags are created yet, you’ll see a placeholder message.

  Assign tags to team members to categorize by **roles** or **departments**.

- **Tag Documents**  
  Apply tags to knowledge base documents for easier organization and retrieval.
