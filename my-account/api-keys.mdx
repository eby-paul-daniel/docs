# API Keys – My Account

The API Keys tab on the EKB platform serves as a tool for you to manage secure access for integrating external applications and automating tasks. This feature provides a streamlined interface where you can generate and manage API keys, which are essential for authenticating and facilitating seamless communication between EKB and other services. Within the API Keys tab, you can view a list of all their generated keys, each accompanied by details such as the key's name, creation date, and management options. This setup ensures that you can easily identify and control your API keys, enhancing security and efficiency. The API Keys tab also offers direct access to comprehensive documentation, providing setup instructions, example requests, and best practices for secure usage. This makes it an invaluable resource for developers aiming to integrate EKB's capabilities into their workflows, automate tasks, and maintain secure connections with external platforms.
