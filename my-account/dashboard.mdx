# Dashboard – Billing & Subscription

The My Account Dashboard is your central hub for managing and monitoring essential aspects of your EKB account. It provides a comprehensive overview of your billing, subscription plan, and credit usage, allowing you to keep track of your team's capacity and available resources. Within the Dashboard, you can view the name of your organization or workspace, the number of active team members, and your current subscription status, whether it's a Free Plan or an Enterprise Plan. The Plan Details section offers insights into your credit usage, showing the total credits consumed, available credits according to your subscription, any additional bonus credits, and the maximum number of team members allowed under your plan. This information is crucial for tracking your subscription usage, monitoring credit balances, and understanding team member limits. By using the Dashboard, you can efficiently manage your credits, seats, and subscription details, ensuring that you are well-prepared to make informed decisions about potential upgrades as your usage approaches its limits.
