## Team Information

- **Team Name**  
  The name of your organization (e.g., _EKB Enterprise_).

- **Team Email Domain**  
  Defines the default domain for your organization (e.g., `getodin.ai`).  
  Any new user with a matching email domain can be automatically added to the team (if the option is enabled).

---

## Security & Access Controls

- **Allow only SSO authentication**  
  Restricts logins to your organization’s preferred identity provider (IdP).  
  This ensures all users must log in via SSO, improving security and centralized access management.

- **Auto Add Users by Domain**  
  Automatically adds users with emails matching your team domain.  
  Useful for onboarding employees without requiring manual invites.

---

## Collaboration Controls

- **Disable Meetings**  
  Prevents members from creating, joining, or managing meetings within EKB.

- **Chat Mode for Members**  
  When enabled, members will only have access to the **AI Hub**.  
  They can use shared projects but won’t be able to create or edit new ones.

- **Members Can Create Projects**  
  Allows team members to create new projects.  
  If disabled, only admins and editors can create projects.

---

## Resource Management

- **User Credit Limits**  
  Lets admins define a default credit usage limit for all users.  
  Limits can also be customized for specific team members when needed.

---

## Updating Settings

Once changes are made, click **Update** to save.  
Your preferences will immediately apply to all team members.

✅ The **Settings** tab helps admins maintain security, streamline onboarding, and control project creation and credit allocation across the team.
