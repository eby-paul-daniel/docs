## Team-Level RBAC

EKB supports **Team-level Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**, which defines what users can access and manage across the Enterprise Knowledge platform as a whole, independent of any individual project. These permissions govern platform-wide capabilities such as creating and managing projects, administering users, configuring team settings, and viewing usage and audit data.

Unlike project-level RBAC, team-level roles are fixed and standardized. Enterprise Knowledge provides three default team-level roles—**Admin**, **Editor**, and **Member**—and does not support Custom Roles at this level. This approach ensures consistent governance, predictable behavior, and strong security controls across the organization.

Team-level RBAC determines:

- Whether a user can create, edit, or delete projects  
- Access to team-wide settings and configurations  
- The ability to add, modify, or remove team members  
- Visibility into usage metrics, credit consumption, and audit logs  
- Access to advanced features such as Agent Mode, depending on team settings  

Team-level RBAC works in conjunction with project-level RBAC. A user must first have an appropriate team-level role to access the platform, and then a project-level role to interact with a specific project. For example, a user may be a **Team Member** with limited administrative privileges, while still being assigned an **Admin** or **Editor** role within specific projects.

## Team-Level Roles and Permissions

When adding a user to a Team in Enterprise Knowledge, you must assign one of the available team-level roles. These roles control a user’s platform-wide permissions and do not define what the user can do within individual projects.

### Member

The **Member** role is intended for standard users who primarily work within projects and do not manage the team or platform configuration.

**Members can:**

- Access and work in projects they have been added to, based on their assigned project-level role  
- Create new projects if the team setting **“Members Can Create Projects”** is enabled  
- Access Agent Mode if the team setting **“Chat Mode for Members”** is enabled  

**Members cannot:**

- Manage team settings  
- Add, remove, or modify other team members  
- View team-wide analytics, logs, or usage data  

---

### Editor

The **Editor** role is designed for power users who need broader control over projects but do not require full administrative access at the team level.

**Editors can:**

- Access, edit, and delete projects, subject to their project-level role  
- Create new projects  
- Access Agent Mode  
- Perform all actions available to Members  

**Editors cannot:**

- Manage team-wide settings  
- Add or remove team members  
- Access team-level usage analytics or logs  

---

### Admin

The **Admin** role provides full control over the Team and is intended for platform owners and administrators.

**Admins can:**

- Perform all actions available to Editors and Members  
- Manage Team Settings  
- Add, modify, and remove team members  
- View all projects and monitor credit and token usage  
- Manage Tags used for users and Knowledge Base documents  
- Configure Agent Mode settings  
- Access usage analytics, audit logs, and team activity logs  

Because Admins have unrestricted access to team-wide configuration and data, this role should be assigned sparingly and only to trusted users.

## Best Practices for Team-Level RBAC

- **Limit Admin access:** Assign the Admin role only to users who require full team oversight.  
- **Use project-level roles for granularity:** Rely on project-level RBAC to control detailed access within projects.  
- **Align roles with responsibilities:** Choose team-level roles based on platform governance needs, not job titles.  
- **Review access regularly:** Periodically audit team roles to ensure permissions remain appropriate as responsibilities evolve.
