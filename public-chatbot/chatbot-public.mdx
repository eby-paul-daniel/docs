EKB offers a Public Chatbot feature that lets you create a no-code AI chatbot powered by your data in real time. You can seamlessly integrate it into your website, Slack, Google Chat, Microsoft Teams, and more. By uploading custom data into your EKB Knowledge Base, EKB agents generate highly contextual, tailored responses that enhance customer engagement. The chatbot is fully customizable, including options for name, branding (colors and logo), placeholder text, suggestions, and more.
