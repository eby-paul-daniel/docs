EKB **Chats** provide an intuitive way to interact with AI agents, enabling you to generate **highly contextualized responses** tailored to your needs. Instead of a one-size-fits-all assistant, Chats lets you select from different pre-configured agents, each specialized for tasks such as **data analysis, document summarization, content generation, image creation, or web research**.

By combining flexible agent selection with features like **file uploads, Knowledge Base integration, and contextual chat memory**, Chats ensure that responses are both relevant and actionable. Depending on the agent and language model you configured for it, you can:
* Analyze structured or unstructured data
* Summarize and interact with documents in real time
* Retrieve fresh insights from the web via Google search
* Generate creative text or images

Chats give you **customizable, multi-purpose AI workspace** where you control the context, the agent, and the outcome.

## Chat Features
- **Agent Selection**: Choose from a variety of pre-configured agents tailored to different tasks and use cases.
- **File Uploads**: Upload documents or images directly into the chat for analysis (see [Chat with Documents](chat-kb) for more details).
- **Knowledge Base Integration**: Interact with documents and data stored in your Knowledge Base for more informed responses.
- **Contextual Responses**: Agents can provide responses based on the context of your previous messages in the chat.
- **Export Responses**: Export AI responses for further use or sharing.
