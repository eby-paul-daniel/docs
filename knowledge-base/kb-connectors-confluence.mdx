With the Confluence connector, you can seamlessly bring pages, spaces, and documentation into EKB’s Knowledge Base. Once connected, EKB keeps your Confluence content synced, making it fully searchable and accessible for AI agents. This integration ensures that important knowledge stored in Confluence is always up to date, empowering your team to retrieve answers, surface insights, and build workflows directly from your existing Confluence content.
