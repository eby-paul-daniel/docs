# Overview

Smart Tables in EKB are dynamic, spreadsheet-style tables built to store, organize, and extract structured data—especially from unstructured sources like PDFs, DOCX files, or scanned documents.

They’re not just tables. They’re intelligent workspaces where you can **upload documents, extract key data using AI**, and structure everything in a way that makes decision-making and automation seamless.

# Review View

The Review View in Smart Tables is designed for human-in-the-loop processes, making it particularly useful for validating or moderating extracted data before it is approved. This view allows users to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the data extracted from documents, providing a layer of human oversight in the data processing workflow.

# Input Tools

Smart Table input tools are features designed to facilitate the entry and management of data within Smart Tables. These tools include the ability to upload various document types such as PDFs, DOCX files, or scanned documents for data extraction. They leverage AI-driven data extraction to automatically extract and map data from uploaded documents into the structured fields of the Smart Table. Additionally, they provide the flexibility for manual data entry, allowing users to input data directly into the table fields. Field configuration is another key tool, enabling customization of fields with different data types, such as text, number, file, single/multi-select, and more, to meet specific data requirements. These input tools streamline the process of converting unstructured data into structured, actionable information, enhancing the efficiency and accuracy of data management within Smart Tables.

# Extraction

Smart Tables extraction refers to the process of using artificial intelligence to automatically extract and map data from unstructured documents, such as PDFs, DOCX files, or scanned documents, into structured fields within a Smart Table. This feature allows users to transform unstructured data into a structured format that is easy to organize, analyze, and utilize for decision-making. The extraction process involves identifying key data points within the documents and aligning them with the predefined fields in the Smart Table, thereby streamlining data entry and enhancing the overall efficiency of data management.
