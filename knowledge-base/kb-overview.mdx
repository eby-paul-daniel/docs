        * **Knowledge Base Settings**: Here are the key settings you can configure:<br/>
        ![Knowledge Base Settings](/img/knowledge-base/kb-data-settings.png)
            1. **Chunking Strategy**: Configure how documents will be divided into chunks for processing. Select between these options:
                * **Sentence Chunking**: Divides text into chunks based on sentence boundaries, ensuring that each chunk contains complete sentences. This option uses the sentence tokenizer for natural language boundaries.
                * **Semantinc Chunking**: Divides text into semantically meaningful chunks, which may not align with sentence boundaries. This option uses the semantic tokenizer for natural language boundaries.
                * **Chunk Configuration**: This configuration appears when you select _Sentence Chunking_. Here you can configure the chunk size and overlap for sentence-based chunking.
                    * **Chunk Size**: Specify the maximum of each chunk in tokens/characters. The default is `64`. The recommendation is between `64` to `512` tokens for most use cases. Larger chunks preserve context but may be less precise for retrieval. 
                    * **Chunk Overlap**: Specify the number of overlapping words between consecutive chunks. This helps maintain context across chunk boundaries. The default is `16`. The recommendation is between 10 to 20% of the set chunk size.
                    * **Chunk Enhancement Settings**: Enable this setting to enhance chunking with additional context for better retrieval. When enabled, you can select an LLM model for chunk enrichment and content analysis.
            2. **Connectors**: Manage third-party integrations like Google Drive, SharePoint, Confluence, and Zoomin.<br/>
            ![Knowledge Base Connectors](/img/knowledge-base/kb-data-connectors.png)
            3. **Crawlers**: Create new web crawlers to fetch data from your website's domain URL. Any page the crawler can discover within the website will be automatically crawled and added to the Knowledge Base. You can also set a sync schedule for automatic crawling that adds the latest information from any newly added pages.<br/>
            ![Knowledge Base Crawlers](/img/knowledge-base/kb-data-crawlers.png)

## Document Viewing Interface

When you click on a document in the Knowledge Base, it opens the document viewing interface. Here, you can read and manage the document's metadata and related information. The interface is divided into two main sections: the document content area and the metadata sidebar.
![Document Viewing Interface](/img/knowledge-base/document-viewing-interface.png)

1. **Document Content Area**: This is where the main content of the document is displayed. At the top of the screen, there's buttons to copy the file name or download the file. **There are three tabs in this area**:<br/>
   **a**. **View**: Displays the content of the file as uploaded.<br/>
   **b**. **Content**: Displays the text content extracted from the file. This is the content that the AI agent will use for retrieval and answering questions.<br/>
   **c**. **Chunks**: Displays the individual chunks of text created based on the chunking strategy configured in the Knowledge Base settings. Each chunk is a smaller segment of the document that can be independently retrieved by the AI agent.<br/>
2. **Details Sidebar**: This sidebar provides additional information and options, including:<br/>
   **d**. **File Details**: Displays information about the file, such as the file name, upload date, upload user, file size, file type, and characters count.<br/>
   **e**. **Document Data Filter**: Allows you to assign a Smart Table to the document for structured data extraction, based on the schema of the Smart Table.<br/>
   **f**. **Custom Metadata**: Allows you to add custom metadata fields to the document for improved document categorization and AI-based retrieval, such as: Author name, Version, Pages, Resolution, Dimensions, Content Creator, Keywords, or any other relevant information.<br/>
   **g**. **Access Tags**: Allows you to add access tags to the document to control who can view or interact with the document. You can create new tags from the **Super Admin Dashboard**.<br/>
3. **Associated Questions**: The Associated Questions tab allows you to add related commonly asked questions that can be answered by the content of the document. This helps improve the AI agent's ability to provide accurate and relevant answers based on the document's content.

## Troubleshooting

This section covers common issues users encounter with the Knowledge Base and Level 1 (L1) diagnostic steps to help identify and resolve them.

### Knowledge Base Not Updating

- AI agent not finding information that exists in the Knowledge Base
- Incorrect or irrelevant search results

**L1 Diagnostic Steps:**

1. **Verify Document Content**

   - Open the document and check the **Content** tab
   - Ensure the text content is accurate and complete
   - Check if the document was processed correctly (no extraction errors)

2. **Check Chunking Configuration**

   - Review **Settings** > **Settings** > **Chunking Strategy**
   - Verify chunk size and overlap settings are appropriate for your content
   - Consider if chunk size is too large (may miss specific information) or too small (may lose context)

3. **Review Embedding Model**

   - Confirm the embedding model in use is suitable for your content type
   - Check if the model supports the language of your documents
   - Verify embedding model consistency between indexing and querying

4. **Test Search Query**

   - Try different phrasings of the same query
   - Use keywords that appear in the document content
   - Check if the search works better with exact phrases vs. keywords

5. **Check Document Metadata**

   - Review custom metadata and tags assigned to documents
   - Ensure documents are properly categorized and tagged
   - Verify access tags aren't restricting visibility

6. **Review Chunks**
   - Open the **Chunks** tab for the document
   - Verify chunks contain the expected information
   - Check if relevant information is split across multiple chunks

### Data Not Visible

**Symptoms:**

- Documents not appearing in the Knowledge Base list
