    # Roles
    EKB supports the RBAC (Role Based Access Control) security model by giving you three default **Role** types: Admin, Editor, and Viewer. These default Roles can be expanded by adding your own **Custom Roles** that enable you to have granular control over what Members of your project have access to and the actions they can perform. In this section you will learn about the default Roles and all of the Custom Role options available.

    ## Default Roles
    - **Admin**: Administrator of the project with full control to edit all settings, add, modify, and remove users, view analytics, and delete the project.
    - **Editor**: Editors can edit all settings except for Roles. Editors cannot add or remove members, but can modify the project.

      noZoom
    />

    ## Custom roles
    **Custom Roles** are created by setting the access controls for each of the following settings to **View Self**, **View All**, or **Edit**. With the exceptions of Chat, when View All or Edit are not selected, the default setting is **N/A** which means either the user will only have access to their own or will not have access to that feature or action. Details on what "N/A" will mean for a particular feature or action are detailed below.
