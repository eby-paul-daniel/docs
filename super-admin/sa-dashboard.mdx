# Super Admin Dashboard Overview

<Callout type="warning">
<strong>Note:</strong> The Super Admin Dashboard is exclusively available to organizations using on-premise deployments of EKB. It is not available on the public cloud-hosted version of the platform.

- Real-time monitoring
- Access management
- Project oversight
- AI usage analytics
- System health tracking

Each tab in this dashboard gives Super Admins actionable insights into how EKB is being used across teams, what tasks are running, how language models are performing, and what system-level configurations or maintenance tasks are needed.

## Dashboard Overview

The Super Admin Dashboard is designed to:

- Monitor the health and load of your system in real-time.
- View usage trends and success rates for task and AI operations.
- Manage users, projects, teams, licenses, and infrastructure-level components.
- Securely configure integrations using secrets, monitor agent executions, and diagnose performance issues.
