**Teams**

The Teams tab is where Super Admins can view, manage, and configure all the teams within the EKB on-premise system. Teams represent organizational groupings—such as departments, customer accounts, project squads, or business units—and are used to control access, resources, and collaborative workflows.
	- Managing large-scale deployments across organizations.
	- Segmenting usage and permissions.
	- Allocating compute and credit resources at the team level.
Efficiently organizing users, assigning and limiting resources such as seats and credits, and maintaining security through role assignments and access control are crucial tasks. By applying team-specific rules that support enterprise governance, you can ensure that whether you're managing 5 teams or 500, each group has exactly what it needs
