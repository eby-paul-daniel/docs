**Users**

1. **Search**: Search for users by User Name or Email.
2. **User Id**: UUID for the user.
3. **Name**: Full name of the user.
4. **Email**: The email address used to log into EKB.
5. **Admin Status**: Whether the user is a “User” or “Admin”. Admins can access this dashboard and perform elevated actions.
6. **Credits Used**: Indicates how many credits (EKB’s internal usage measure) have been consumed by the project / user.
    - Credits are consumed through:
      - Chat Usage: Each prompt in the chat consumes n credits based on what’s defined for that particular measure.
      - Knowledge Base (KB) Usage: Extraction of documents → up to 5000 words → 1 credit
    - Monitoring credit usage here helps identify high-activity or resource-heavy projects and optimise system performance and cost management of LLMs.
7. **Actions**: “Make Admin” (grants super admin rights), “View Team” (opens team assignments and roles), and Delete User (Deletes the User from your instance).
