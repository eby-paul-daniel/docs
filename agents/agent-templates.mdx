EKB's **Agent Templates** provide a fast, structured way to launch intelligent agents without starting from zero. Each template comes with **predefined behaviors, toolkits, and best practices** designed for specific workflows–whether it's knowledge retrieval, data analysis, research, project management, or automation. You can customize templates to control how agents respond, what data they access, and which models they run on, giving you both **speed to deployment** and **fine-grained flexibility**.
