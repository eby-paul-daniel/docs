## Introduction

What is the Agent Builder in EKB Platform?
The Agent Builder is an advanced, enterprise-grade feature in the EKB platform specifically designed to empower organizations to create, configure, and deploy intelligent autonomous agents. Unlike standard chatbots that are constrained to simple conversational exchanges based on pre-defined scripts or limited knowledge bases, an Agent within this ecosystem is a specialized digital entity. These agents are equipped with specific instructions (personality), persistent memory, and, crucially, "Toolkits" that grant them the ability to interact dynamically with the real world, enterprise systems, and data sources.

The platform operates as a robust bridge between state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs) and your critical business data, software applications, and operational workflows. It significantly abstracts the technical complexity associated with prompt engineering, API integration, authentication management, and context window handling. This abstraction provides a streamlined, user-friendly interface where anyone—from technical developers to business analysts and domain experts—can construct powerful AI assistants tailored to specific business needs without writing extensive code.

The value proposition of the Agent Builder Platform lies in its ability to transform AI from a passive information retrieval tool into an active participant in business processes. By enabling agents to perform actions—such as querying databases, generating documents, sending emails, and executing code—organizations can automate complex, multi-step workflows that previously required human intervention. This shift from "chatting with AI" to "working with AI agents" represents a fundamental evolution in enterprise productivity and automation.

### Platform Architecture & Overview

The architecture is built on a modular, four-layer system designed for scalability, security, and flexibility:

- **Core Intelligence Layer:** This foundational layer is powered by the selected Large Language Model (e.g., GPT-5 Series, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Gemini 3). It handles the heavy lifting of cognitive processing, including reasoning, language understanding, context synthesis, and decision-making logic. It is the "brain" that interprets user intent and formulates plans.
- **Tooling Layer (The "Arms and Legs"):** This operational layer connects the core intelligence to external systems and the physical world. It includes a comprehensive suite of native toolkits for executing code, browsing the web, querying databases, and manipulating files. It translates the LLM's intent into concrete API calls and system commands.
- **Integration Layer:** This connectivity layer enables seamless interaction with the enterprise software ecosystem. It features a vast library of pre-built, secure connectors for major third-party services like Salesforce, Microsoft 365, Jira, ServiceNow, and more. It manages API endpoints, data formats, and protocol negotiation.
- **Orchestration Layer:** This management layer oversees the entire lifecycle of an interaction. It manages the flow of data between the user, the agent, and the tools, handling critical functions such as authentication, error recovery, state management, and multi-agent delegation. It ensures that complex, multi-step tasks are executed reliably and securely.

### Key Capabilities

The Agent Builder Platform offers a distinct set of capabilities that differentiate it from standard AI interfaces:

- **Custom Personalities:** Administrators can define rigid behavioral constraints and persona definitions. An agent can be configured to strictly adhere to specific communication styles, such as a formal compliance officer, a creative marketing copywriter, or an empathetic customer support representative, ensuring brand consistency.
- **Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG):** The platform natively integrates vector database technology to handle document ingestion and retrieval. Users can simply upload documents (PDFs, DOCX, TXT), and the agent automatically gains the ability to perform semantic searches and reference this specific knowledge base during conversations, grounding its answers in verified data.
- **Real-time Web Access:** Agents are not limited to the static training data of their underlying LLMs. They possess the capability to browse the live internet securely to fetch real-time stock prices, breaking news, competitor data, or regulatory updates, ensuring that their responses are always current and relevant.
- **Secure Code Execution:** For tasks requiring mathematical precision, data transformation, or algorithmic logic, agents can write and execute Python or Node.js code in secure, isolated sandboxes. This capability allows for on-the-fly generation of charts, complex analysis of Excel files, data cleaning, and simulation modeling.
- **Enterprise Integration:** The platform supports robust OAuth 2.0 authentication protocols for services like Microsoft 365 and Google Workspace. This means the agent acts on behalf of the user, respecting all existing permission structures, access controls, and security policies defined within the organization.
- **Visualizations:** The system includes an intelligent visualization engine that can automatically detect when data is best presented visually. It can render interactive charts (Bar, Pie, Line, Scatter) directly within the chat interface, transforming raw data tables into actionable visual insights instantly.

### Use Cases Across Industries

| Industry | Scenario |
|----------|----------|
| Finance | Agents that query SQL databases to generate daily P&L reports, visualize market trends, and perform risk analysis on portfolio data. |
| HR | "Resume Screener" agents that read PDF applications, compare them against job descriptions in the Knowledge Base, draft rejection or interview emails, and schedule meetings. |
| Software Development | "PR Reviewer" agents that analyze GitHub pull requests, check for code style violations, suggest optimizations, and automatically generate documentation updates. |
| Sales | "Lead Enrichment" agents that take a prospect's email, search the web for their company details, look them up in Salesforce, identify decision-makers, and draft personalized outreach emails. |

## Getting Started

### Creating a New Project

The fundamental unit of organization and collaboration in the Agent Builder is the Project. A project acts as a secure, isolated container for all resources related to a specific business function, team, or initiative. Within a project, you manage Agents (the AI assistants themselves), Knowledge Bases (files and documents specific to this workspace), Documents (text files created or managed by the agents), and Databases (connections to SQL or Smart Tables).
Creating a project establishes a dedicated workspace with its own settings, permissions, and resource quotas. This isolation is crucial for maintaining data security and organizing workflows, especially in large enterprises with multiple departments. To create a new project, simply click the "+" icon in the sidebar. You will be prompted to name your project (e.g., "HR Automation", "Q3 Financial Analysis"). Once created, you enter the project workspace where you can begin adding agents and resources.

### Agent Creation Methods

From the main dashboard, clicking "Create Agent" presents two primary pathways, catering to different user expertise levels:

**Create from Prompt (AI-Assisted)**
This is the fastest and most accessible way to get started, ideal for users who are new to prompt engineering or want to prototype quickly. You describe your intent in natural language. For example: "I need an assistant that can help me research competitor pricing on the web and save the data into a Google Sheet." The system analyzes your request using a specialized meta-prompt and automatically configures the agent. It selects an appropriate name (e.g., "Market Research Assistant"), writes a comprehensive system prompt defining the persona and objectives, and enables the necessary toolkits (Web Search, Google Sheets) required to fulfill the request.

**Create Custom Agent (Manual)**
For advanced users, prompt engineers, and developers, this option provides full granular control over every aspect of the agent's configuration. You manually configure the Name & Icon for branding, select the specific LLM version based on performance needs, manually toggle the specific integrations and toolkits required, and write the detailed system instruction from scratch to fine-tune behavior. This method is recommended for production-grade agents where precise control over behavior and capabilities is paramount.

### Agent Templates

To accelerate development and standardize best practices, the platform offers a rich library of pre-configured templates. These are "blueprints" for common use cases, coming with optimized pre-written prompts and pre-selected tool configurations.

- **Knowledge & Support:** Includes "Knowledge Base Agent" (pre-configured for RAG, ideal for policy QA) and "Customer Service Rep" (tuned for empathy, de-escalation, and support protocols).
- **Data & Analytics:** Includes "Data Analyst" (equipped with Python and Database tools for complex analysis) and "SQL Reporter" (specialized in writing accurate, optimized SQL queries).
- **Research:** Includes "Research Assistant" (configured with Web Search and academic sourcing rules) and "Market Analyst" (focuses on competitor data aggregation and trend analysis).
- **Project Management:** Includes "Agile Scrum Master" (integrated with Jira/Asana to manage sprints, standups, and backlog refinement).
- **Development:** Includes "Python Developer" (a coding assistant with file system access and debugging capabilities) and "QA Automation" (scripts tests and reports bugs).
- **Business Operations:** Includes "Vendor Onboarding" (guides users through compliance checklists) and "Financial Analyst" (connects to Excel and Yahoo Finance for market tracking).

### Dashboard Navigation Guide

Once inside a project, the interface is expertly designed for productivity, divided into three main areas:

- **Left Sidebar (Navigation):** Provides quick access to the core modules: Chat interface, Agent Settings configuration, Knowledge Base management, and Integrations setup. It serves as the primary navigation controller for the project.
- **Center Panel (Chat/Canvas):** The main interaction area where you converse with the agent, view its outputs, and visualize data. This is the "runtime" environment where the agent executes tasks and presents results.
- **Right Panel (Context/Settings):** Displays active tool configurations, file uploads, and specific parameters for the current session. It provides context-aware controls and information relevant to the current task or selected agent.
