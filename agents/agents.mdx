An EKB agent is a customizable, artificial intelligence-powered tool designed to automate a wide range of business tasks and workflows without requiring users to have coding expertise. At its core, EKB provides a platform that enables businesses to build, train, and deploy these agents to handle specific operational needs.

Setting up and configuring an AI agent sounds complex, but EKB simplifies the process into manageable steps that ensure your agent performs efficiently and aligns with your business objectives. 

Let's break it down into an easy-to-understand guide for planning, configuring, and deploying an AI agent.

To edit your already created agents, follow these steps:

1. **Access the Agents Page**: Click on **Agents** from the sidebar navigation menu then locate the specific agent you want to edit.

3. **Make Default**: Clicking on **Make Default** will set the agent as the default agent for all chats. This will be the agent that is used when no other agent is explicitly selected in the chat. The tile for the selected default agent will be highlighted in light blue and the agent name will also be prefixed with "**Default**". 
<Note>Note that you can only have one default agent.</Note>
