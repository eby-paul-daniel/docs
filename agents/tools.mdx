# Tools

The **Tools** tab in the Agent Builder allows you to add custom tools and workflows to your agents. Unlike **Toolkits** (which are pre-built integrations), **Tools** are user-created custom tools and workflows that extend your agent's capabilities with specific functionality tailored to your needs.

## Overview

**Tools** enable you to:

- **Add Custom Tools**: Attach custom tools you've created in your project
- **Add Workflows**: Include workflows/actions that execute multi-step processes
- **Create New Tools**: Build new custom tools directly from the agent builder
- **Manage Tool Configuration**: Configure how tools are used by the agent
- **Browse Tool Library**: Access thousands of pre-built tools from the public library

## Tools vs. Toolkits

Understanding the difference helps you choose the right approach:

| Feature | Tools | Toolkits |
|---------|-------|----------|
| **Type** | Custom tools and workflows | Pre-built integrations |
| **Creation** | User-created or from library | Pre-configured by EKB |
| **Scope** | Project-specific or public | Platform-wide integrations |
| **Configuration** | Full customization | Pre-configured with options |
| **Examples** | Custom API calls, workflows, business logic | Gmail, Slack, Google Drive, etc. |

**When to Use Tools:**
- You need custom business logic
- You want to create reusable workflows
- You need to integrate with custom APIs
- You want to combine multiple operations into one tool

**When to Use Toolkits:**
- You need standard integrations (Gmail, Slack, etc.)
- You want pre-configured authentication
- You need common operations (send email, create task, etc.)

   - Click **Configure** on an added tool
   - Adjust tool-specific settings
   - Set approval requirements (if needed)

2. **Tool Approval Settings**
   - **Auto-execute**: Tool runs automatically when triggered

## Tool Types

### Custom Tools

Custom tools are tools you create with:

- **Custom Logic**: Your own business rules and processes
- **API Integrations**: Connect to your own APIs
- **Multi-Step Operations**: Combine multiple actions
- **Data Processing**: Transform and manipulate data

**Creating Custom Tools:**
1. Define inputs (parameters the tool accepts)
2. Configure steps (what the tool does)
3. Set up error handling
4. Test the tool
5. Publish when ready

### Workflows

Workflows are multi-step processes that can:

- **Execute Sequences**: Run multiple operations in order
- **Handle Triggers**: Respond to form inputs or file uploads
- **Process Data**: Transform data through multiple steps
- **Integrate Services**: Connect multiple services together

**Workflow Triggers:**
- **Form Input**: User provides input via a form
- **File Upload**: User uploads files for processing
- **Manual**: Execute on demand by the agent

### Public Tools

The public tool library includes:

- **9,000+ Tools**: Pre-built tools from the community
- **Various Categories**: Communication, productivity, data, etc.
- **Ready to Use**: Clone and customize for your needs
- **Regularly Updated**: New tools added frequently

**Using Public Tools:**
1. Browse the public library
2. Find a tool that matches your needs
3. Clone it to your project
4. Customize if needed
5. Add to your agent

## Best Practices

### Tool Organization

1. **Name Clearly**: Use descriptive names that explain the tool's purpose
2. **Document Well**: Add clear descriptions for each tool
3. **Group Related Tools**: Organize tools by function or category
4. **Version Control**: Use drafts for testing before publishing

### Tool Selection

1. **Start Simple**: Begin with basic tools and add complexity gradually
2. **Test Thoroughly**: Test tools before adding to production agents
3. **Consider Performance**: Too many tools can slow down agent responses
4. **Review Regularly**: Remove unused tools to keep agents efficient

### Tool Configuration

1. **Set Appropriate Defaults**: Configure sensible default values
2. **Use Approval When Needed**: Require approval for sensitive operations
3. **Handle Errors**: Ensure tools have proper error handling
4. **Document Inputs**: Clearly document what each input does
