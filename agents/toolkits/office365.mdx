   - OAuth flow uses EKB's pre-configured Microsoft app
   - Access to Outlook, Calendar, OneDrive, and SharePoint
   - No additional setup or credentials needed

### On-Premise Customers (Self-Hosted)

If you're running EKB on your own infrastructure, you'll need to set up your own OAuth app:

2. **Create New Registration**

   - Click "New registration"
   - Choose a name for your app
   - Select "Accounts in any organizational directory and personal Microsoft accounts"
   - Set redirect URI: `https://your-domain.com/user/integrations/office365/oauth/callback`

3. **Configure API Permissions**

   - Add Microsoft Graph permissions:
     - `Mail.ReadWrite` - Read and write mail

   - Copy the Application (client) ID

2. **Create Client Secret**

   - Go to "Certificates & secrets"
   - Click "New client secret"
   - Copy the secret value (you won't see it again)

3. **Note the Tenant ID**
   - Copy the Directory (tenant) ID from the overview page

#### Step 3: Configure in EKB

     - **Office 365 Client Secret**: Your client secret value
     - **Office 365 Tenant ID**: Your Directory (tenant) ID
     - **Office 365 Redirect URI**: Your configured redirect URI

## Best Practices

### Security

- Use minimal required permissions
- Regularly rotate client secrets
- Monitor access logs and API usage
- Implement proper error handling
- Use conditional access policies when possible

### Performance

- Use batch operations when possible
- Implement rate limiting to respect API limits
- Cache frequently accessed data
- Use appropriate query filters
- Handle API rate limits gracefully

### User Experience

- Provide clear error messages
- Implement retry mechanisms for failed operations
- Use proper email formatting (HTML vs plain text)
- Respect user preferences and settings
- Provide progress indicators for long operations

## Rate Limits

Microsoft Graph API has the following rate limits:

- **10,000 requests per 10 minutes** per application
- **4 requests per second** per user
