## Setup Overview

All communication toolkits require OAuth authentication. Here's what you need to know:

### OAuth Setup Process

1. **Create App**: Register your application with the service provider
2. **Configure Permissions**: Set up the required OAuth scopes
3. **Get Credentials**: Obtain Client ID and Client Secret
4. **Configure Redirect URI**: Set up the callback URL
5. **Add to EKB**: Enter credentials in the Super Admin panel

### Shared OAuth Groups

Some toolkits share OAuth configurations:

- **Google Workspace**: Gmail shares OAuth with other Google services (Drive, Docs, Sheets, etc.)
- **Microsoft 365**: Outlook shares OAuth with Excel, Word, and other Microsoft services

## Best Practices

### Security

- Use minimal required permissions
- Regularly rotate OAuth credentials
- Monitor access logs
- Implement proper error handling

### Performance

- Cache authentication tokens
- Implement rate limiting
- Use batch operations when possible
- Handle API rate limits gracefully

### User Experience

- Provide clear error messages
- Implement retry mechanisms
- Use appropriate message formatting
- Respect user preferences

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Authentication Errors**

- Verify OAuth credentials are correct
- Check redirect URI matches exactly
- Ensure required scopes are granted
- Verify app is approved (if required)

**Permission Errors**

- Confirm OAuth scopes include required permissions
- Check if admin consent is needed
- Verify user has access to requested resources

**Rate Limiting**

- Implement exponential backoff
- Use batch operations
- Monitor API usage
- Consider upgrading API limits

1. **Choose Your Toolkit**: Select the communication platform you need
2. **Review Requirements**: Check the specific setup guide for your chosen toolkit
3. **Set Up OAuth**: Follow the OAuth configuration steps
