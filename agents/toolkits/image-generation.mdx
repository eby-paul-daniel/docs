# Image Generation Toolkit

This toolkit gives the agent the ability to act as a creative director, generating high-fidelity images on demand using DALL-E 3. It transforms text descriptions into visual assets instantly. The agent can create original artwork, illustrations, diagrams, and photorealistic images based on natural language descriptions.

## Configuration Options

The Image Generation Toolkit configuration panel allows you to set default preferences for image generation:

- **Provider**: DALL-E (OpenAI) - The AI image generation provider.
- **Model**: DALL-E 3 - The model version used for image generation.
- **Default Image Size**: Choose from 1024x1024 (Square), 1024x1792 (Portrait), or 1792x1024 (Landscape).
- **Default Quality**: Standard (faster, lower cost) or HD (more detailed, higher cost).
- **Maximum Images Per Request**: Generate 1-4 images at once (set range 1-4).

## Image Size Options

| Size | Description | Use Case |
|------|-------------|----------|
| 1024x1024 (Square) | Standard square format | Avatars, icons |
| 1024x1792 (Portrait) | Vertical orientation | Phone wallpapers, posters |
| 1792x1024 (Landscape) | Horizontal orientation | Desktop wallpapers, slides |

## Available Tools

The Image Generation Toolkit provides one tool that can be enabled or disabled:

- **Generate Images**: Generate one or more images from a natural language prompt using DALL-E. This tool can be configured to require user confirmation before execution.

## Storage & Display

- **Automatic Upload**: Generated images are automatically uploaded to your project storage.
- **Persistent URLs**: Images receive permanent URLs for reliable access.
- **Chat Integration**: Images are attached to chat messages and displayed immediately in responses.

## Prompting Best Practices

- Be specific about style, lighting, and composition (e.g., "shot from above with natural sunlight").
- Use descriptive adjectives (e.g., "cinematic lighting," "hyper-realistic," "minimalist," "vintage").
- Avoid vague terms like "cool" or "nice" - instead describe exactly what you want.
- Iterate on prompts based on generated results - refine and adjust for better output.
- Specify perspective and framing (e.g., "close-up portrait," "wide-angle landscape," "bird's eye view").
- Include art style references when helpful (e.g., "in the style of Art Nouveau," "watercolor painting").
- Mention mood and atmosphere (e.g., "mysterious," "cheerful," "dramatic," "serene").
- For technical diagrams, be precise about layout and elements required.

## Use Cases

- **Marketing**: "Generate 5 concepts for our new sneaker ad campaign."
- **Storyboarding**: "Create a scene showing a cyberpunk city in rain."
- **Web Design**: "Generate a placeholder hero image for a gardening website."
- **Presentations**: "Create an illustration representing 'Cloud Security' for my slide deck."
