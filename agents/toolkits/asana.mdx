## Setup Instructions

### Cloud Customers (EKB Hosted)

**No setup required!** Asana toolkit is enabled by default for all cloud customers. Users can connect their Asana accounts directly:

1. **Connect Asana Account**
   - Users can connect their Asana accounts directly from their agent settings
   - OAuth flow uses EKB's pre-configured Asana app
   - No additional setup or credentials needed

### On-Premise Customers (Self-Hosted)

If you're running EKB on your own infrastructure, you'll need to set up your own OAuth app:

#### Prerequisites

- Asana account with API access
- Asana Developer Console access
- EKB Super Admin access

#### Step 1: Asana Developer Console Setup

1. **Go to Asana Developer Console**

   - Visit [developers.asana.com](https://developers.asana.com)
   - Sign in with your Asana account

2. **Create New App**

   - Click "Create new app"
   - Choose "Personal access token" or "OAuth app"
   - For OAuth: Choose "OAuth app"

3. **Configure App Details**

   - **App Name**: Choose a descriptive name
   - **App URL**: Your application URL
   - **Redirect URI**: `https://your-odin-domain.com/user/integrations/asana/oauth/callback`

4. **Set OAuth Scopes**
   - **Required Scopes**:
     - `read_user` - Read user information
     - `read_workspace` - Read workspace data
   - **Optional Scopes** (if needed):
     - `write` - Write access to projects and tasks
     - `delete` - Delete projects and tasks

#### Step 2: Get Credentials

1. **Copy Client ID and Secret**

   - From your app settings page
   - Copy the Client ID and Client Secret

2. **Note the Redirect URI**
   - Ensure it matches your EKB installation URL

#### Step 3: Configure in EKB

1. **Access Super Admin Panel**

   - Log in to your EKB instance as Super Admin
   - Navigate to Super Admin > Toolkits

2. **Add Asana Configuration**

   - Find Asana in the toolkit list
   - Enter the following credentials:
     - **Asana Client ID**: Your OAuth Client ID
     - **Asana Client Secret**: Your OAuth Client Secret
     - **Asana Redirect URI**: Your configured redirect URI

3. **Save Configuration**
   - Click "Save" to store the configuration


## Best Practices

### Project Organization

- Use consistent naming conventions
- Create clear project hierarchies
- Set up proper project templates
- Use custom fields for additional metadata

### Task Management

- Break down large tasks into smaller subtasks
- Use clear and descriptive task names
- Set realistic due dates
- Assign tasks to appropriate team members

### Automation

- Use webhooks for real-time updates
- Implement proper error handling
- Cache frequently accessed data
- Monitor API usage and rate limits

## Rate Limits

Asana API has the following rate limits:

- **1,500 requests per minute** for most endpoints
- **100 requests per minute** for some endpoints
- **Rate limit headers** included in responses

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Authentication Errors**

```
Error: invalid_grant
```

- **Solution**: Verify OAuth credentials and redirect URI

**Permission Errors**

```
Error: insufficient_permission
```

- **Solution**: Ensure required OAuth scopes are granted

**Rate Limit Exceeded**

```
Error: rateLimitExceeded
```

- **Solution**: Implement exponential backoff and reduce request frequency

**Project Not Found**

```
Error: project_not_found
```

- **Solution**: Verify project ID and user access permissions

### Debug Tips

1. **Test API Access**

   - Use Asana's API explorer to test credentials
   - Verify OAuth flow works independently
   - Check scope permissions

2. **Monitor API Usage**

   - Review Asana Developer Console for usage statistics
   - Monitor quota consumption
   - Set up alerts for rate limit approaches

3. **Check Workspace Access**
   - Verify user has access to requested workspaces
   - Check project permissions
   - Ensure proper team membership
