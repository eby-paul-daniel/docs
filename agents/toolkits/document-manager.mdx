# Document Manager Toolkit

The Document Manager Toolkit enables your agent to create and edit documents directly within chat conversations. This toolkit provides seamless document creation and editing workflows, allowing agents to generate documents that users can review and modify in real-time without leaving the chat interface.

## Available Tools

The Document Manager Toolkit provides three core tools for document management:

- **Create Document**: Create a new empty document. This opens the document tab on the frontend and creates an empty document ready for editing.
- **Edit Document**: Edit a document with real-time streaming updates. Content is written in markdown format and streamed to the frontend in real-time, allowing users to see changes as they happen.
- **List Documents**: List all documents in the project. Use this to see what documents already exist before creating or updating documents.

## Key Features

- **Real-Time Streaming**: Document edits stream to the frontend in real-time for immediate visibility.
- **Markdown Support**: Documents are created and edited using markdown format for easy formatting.
- **Document Tab Integration**: New documents automatically open in the document tab for easy access.
- **Project-Level Management**: All documents are managed within the current project workspace.

## Use Cases

- **Report Generation**: Create business reports with real-time updates visible to users.
- **Content Drafting**: Generate draft content for emails, proposals, or marketing materials.
- **Documentation**: Create technical documentation or meeting notes with markdown formatting.
- **Collaborative Writing**: Edit documents iteratively with streaming updates showing progress.
- **Document Organization**: List existing documents to avoid duplicates and maintain organization.

## Best Practices

- **List Before Creating**: Always use List Documents to check what exists before creating new documents.
- **Use Markdown**: Take advantage of markdown formatting for structured, professional-looking documents.
- **Descriptive Names**: Use clear, descriptive names when creating documents for easy identification.
- **Stream Awareness**: Remember that edits stream in real-time - users will see content as it's written.
