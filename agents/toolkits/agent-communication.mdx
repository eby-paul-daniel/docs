# Agent Communication Toolkit

Enables Multi-Agent Systems (MAS). Allows a "Manager" agent to delegate tasks to specialized "Worker" agents. This toolkit transforms a single-agent system into a coordinated multi-agent architecture where different agents with specialized capabilities can work together to solve complex problems.

## Key Features

- **Agent Selection**: Intelligent routing mechanism that analyzes task requirements and selects the most appropriate specialized agent for the job.
- **Context Passing**: Seamlessly transfers conversation history and relevant context between agents to maintain continuity.
- **Response Integration**: Aggregates outputs from multiple worker agents into a coherent response for the user.
- **Fallback Handling**: If a specialist agent fails, the system can route to alternative agents or escalate to human intervention.
- **Agent Discovery**: Automatically detects available agents in the workspace and their capabilities.
- **Task Orchestration**: Coordinates complex workflows involving multiple agents working in sequence or parallel.

## Design Patterns

- **Hub and Spoke (Router)**: Central coordinator routes requests to specialized agents.
- **Sequential Chain (Pipeline)**: Tasks flow through a sequence of agents.
- **Parallel Processing (Fan-Out)**: Multiple agents work simultaneously on subtasks.
- **Hierarchical (Tree)**: Multi-level delegation with supervisory agents.
- **Expert Panel (Committee)**: Multiple specialists provide opinions; coordinator synthesizes.
