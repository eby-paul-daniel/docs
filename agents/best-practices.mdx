## Best Practices and Tips

### Security & Privacy

- **Principle of Least Privilege:** Grant agents only minimum required tools and permissions.
- **Human-in-the-Loop:** Configure approval workflows for high-risk actions (bulk emails, DB writes).
- **Data Access Controls:** Use role-based access and PII masking.
- **Credential Management:** Secure storage, rotation policies, never hardcode.
- **Audit Logging:** Log all actions for compliance.
- **Prompt Injection Protection:** Protect against malicious inputs.

### Performance Optimization

- **System Prompt Engineering:** Use clear, structured prompts.
- **Knowledge Base Optimization:** Optimize file sizes, chunking, and naming.
- **Context & Token Management:** Balance quality with cost/latency.
- **Tool Usage:** Minimize calls, use parallel execution and caching.

### User Experience

- **Latency Management:** Set expectations for long operations.
- **Error Handling:** Graceful degradation and user-friendly messages.
- **Feedback Loops:** Mechanisms for iterative improvement.

### Production Readiness Checklist

- **Configuration verification** (prompts, tools).
- **Security verification** (permissions, approvals).
- **Testing verification** (happy path, edge cases).
- **Monitoring setup** (metrics, alerts).
- **Documentation requirements** (guides, troubleshooting).
- **Compliance verification** (GDPR, etc.).

### Troubleshooting Guide

| Issue | Symptoms | Solution |
|-------|----------|----------|
| Agent not using tools | Responds "I don't have access" | Check tool enabled, description clear, prompt instruction. |
| Hallucinating data | Invents information | Instruct agents to say "I don't know" when information is missing. |
| Slow responses | Queries >1 0 seconds | Check context size, optimize KB, use parallel execution. |
| Tool auth failure | Unauthorized error | Verify credentials, check token expiry, confirm scopes. |
