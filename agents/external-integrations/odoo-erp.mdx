## Best Practices

- **Use External IDs**: Assign external IDs to records for stable cross-system references.
- **Batch Operations**: Use search_read and write on multiple IDs to reduce API calls.
- **Field Selection**: Always specify fields to read rather than retrieving all fields.
- **Domain Filters**: Use efficient domain expressions for searches ([('field', 'operator', 'value')]).
- **Context Usage**: Pass appropriate context for multi-company, language, or special behavior.
- **Error Handling**: Check workflow states before calling action methods (confirm, validate).

## Common Issues & Solutions

- **Record Not Found**: Verify record ID exists and user has read access.
- **Method Not Found**: Ensure method exists on model and is callable via XML-RPC.
