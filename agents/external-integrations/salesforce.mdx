## API Limits & Quotas

Salesforce enforces API call limits based on edition and license type. Professional: 1,000 calls/day, Enterprise: 5,000+ calls/day, Unlimited: 10,000+ calls/day. Monitor usage in Setup → System Overview → API Usage. Use bulk operations to maximize efficiency.

## Common Issues & Solutions

- **API Limit Exceeded**: Implement caching, use bulk operations, or request limit increase from Salesforce.
- **Invalid Field**: Verify field API names (often differ from display labels). Check field-level security.
- **Record Type Mismatch**: Ensure correct record type ID when creating records with multiple record types.
- **Validation Rules**: Failed saves may be due to Salesforce validation rules. Review error messages carefully.
