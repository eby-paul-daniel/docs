## Rate Limits

Monitor HTTP 429 responses and implement retry-after delays. Use pagination for large result sets (default: 100 items per page).

## Common Issues & Solutions

- **Task Not Found**: Verify task GID is correct and user has access to the task's project.
- **Permission Denied**: Ensure user has appropriate project access level (commenter, editor, admin).
- **Custom Field Errors**: Verify custom field type matches value being set (number, text, enum).
- **Rate Limit**: Implement exponential backoff and respect Retry-After header in 429 responses.
