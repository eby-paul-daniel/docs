1. Select Create New Project.
2. Enter a name for your Project.
3. Select the Create button.

Your first project is up and running with three built-in chat agents available by default. In the next section you’ll build your first AI Agent just as quickly and easily!

## Create a Custom Agent

The Custom Agents Settings section of the Agents page is where you create and keep your Custom Agents. Below are the instructions to create your own Custom Agent.

2. In the **Agent Name** field, give your Agent a name.
3. Choose one of the many popular LLM models for your Agent to use.
4. Update the **Personality Prompt** to define how your Agent will operate and **save your changes.**
5. Choose one or more \*\*Toolkits \*\*from the Toolkits page on the left navigation menu. _Note that some Toolkits, such as Gmail and Jira require additional configuration details, such as access credentials, to be connected._
6. After your Toolkits are added and configured, **save your changes** and select \*\*General \*\*to go back to the Agent’s prompt.
7. Update the prompt by typing the ‘**@**’ **symbol**. This opens a menu where you can select a \*\*Tool \*\*from your available \*\*Toolkits \*\*and tell your Agent how to use it. 
8. **Save your changes** and go to the Chat page to test your Agent!

Once your AI Agent is running, you can set it as the Default Agent for all Chats on the Agents page.

## Agent Templates

The Agents page also includes several Agent Templates with specialized purposes, such as Research Assistant, Python Developer, and Data Analyst. To add one of these Agents to your Project, select it, choose the AI Model you want it to use, then select the Create button.
